      MetroTune is a new way to access tools for learning an instrument -
      particularly guitar. This web app will provide you with an all in one
      place to learn the basics of music. The tuner will allow users to
      precisely tune their instrument to whatever frequency they prefer. There 
      are a range of reference notes to practice ear training. The
      metronome will allow musicians to be able to practice their tempo. 
      
      <p id="homeText">Enjoy learning!</p>
