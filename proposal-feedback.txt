CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Jayden Craig
MetroTune project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   The proposal document is a good start, but lacks some of the required
   information.  The project description is pretty good, but could use a bit
   more on how it will work for the user ~ will it use the computer's own
   microphone?  Will the instrument plug in to the computer?  How will the
   tuning be indicated ~ by a graph, or by beats, or by red/yellow/green
   icons on the screen?  Etc.

   Missing entirely is the justification section.  Uh-oh....

   Your poster is nice, with the colors, different for each block.  Very
   eye-catching!  The logo is cool, too.  You do need an LMU seal on there,
   along with the presentation date.  I also note that your project this
   time is "MetroTune" but the poster is about "TunerTeacher"...  hmmm.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Excellent job on the presentation.  I think you have a good project.  I
   think you might try to consider another element to add as a stretch goal,
   since you already have the tuner portion working and adding the metronome
   seems like you can do that relatively easily.  ....just sayin'....

   All in all, though, nice work.  Your presentation skills could benefit if
   you look more at the audience when presenting ~ you were looking mostly
   at the slides on the screen.
