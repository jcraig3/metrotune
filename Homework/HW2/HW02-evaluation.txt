Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

I like your thinking on 5.6 ~ exploring more than one possibility is usually
a good thing.

One small error on your diagram for 5.8 where you have "digit" as the action
between "Digit or Decimal" at the top center and "Enter" at the end.  I'm
pretty sure you mean "Enter" there as you have on the other paths going to
the accept state...

Excellent job on this, Jayden ~ you're doing great, so keep it up!!
