============================================================================

Your score: 48 out of 50 = 96% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-5: Actually, it's better to add error handling to the CALLER, not
   into the CALLED code.  The called code will throw an exception, and that
   should be handled by the CALLER.

problem 8-1: I think you misunderstood the problem here.  "Relatively prime"
   doesn't mean the numbers themselves are prime, just that they don't have
   any common factors BETWEEN them.  You don't need to check if they are
   prime numbers.

problem 8-11: Lincoln index only deals with pairs, not threes.  For this, it
   requires three calculations: A and B, B and C, A and C, then average those
   three results.  You should end up with 14 bugs.

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
