CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Jayden Craig
MetroTune project
=============================================

Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   Very nice job on this document.

-- Introduction Section
   Great work on the explanations for each of the deliverables!  This is a
   very helpful section as a result.

-- Project Resources Section
   This is minimal, of course.  Since there is so little information needed
   you don't need to put each section on its own page.

-- Project Organization Section
   Perfect, no other comments, no adjustments needed here.

-- Project Schedule Section
   Also perfect, no other comments, no adjustments needed here.

=============================================================================
your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

You are good to go.  Full credit for both the first and second submission,
but don't forget to condense those nearly blank pages in the resources section.
