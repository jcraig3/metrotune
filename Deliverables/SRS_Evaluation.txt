Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Excellent work on this section!  Nothing to add here.  The diagram is
   great to show the parts and their associations.

-- Functional Requirements
   The only observation here is that all the "must" words should be changed
   to "shall".  The requirements language uses "shall" never "must".

   Otherwise, perfect, nothing to add.

-- Performance Requirements
   Same comment as in functional sections.

-- Environment Requirements
   Same comment as in functional sections.


=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, an excellent job!

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
